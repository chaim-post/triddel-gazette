            <p>This game is a work in progress. At the moment it doesnâ€™t 
            work at all but that is soon to change. The completed game 
            is planned to have at least 10 different possible paths for 
            the player to choose with many sub-paths within each major 
            storyline. I plan on creating each storyline one at a time 
            to allow a more complete experience sooner. 
            Thanks for reading and check back soon!</p>

                He leads you out of the offices and down the street to the local 
                portal of the city portal network. You show your passes to the guard
                and he sets the destination to Gearhome. Stepping through the the 
                black stone ring you find yourself in the Gnomish industrial, the shadows of the larger city above casting a perpetual twilight on the noisy smoke filled ward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turning to you Rupert asks <q>"Where exactly did you say this boat was?"</q>

            <p>
                The old man didn't tell you where in gearhome the boat was being constucted what do you do?

            <!--TODO: style blockquotes to match p, first letter large bold, etc. -->
            <p>You walk through the crowds of Gnomes, Dwarves, and Human workmen until you come to a small parts shop, 
                stepping inside Rupert calls to a man behind the counter, <q>"Hey, Will, I was wondering if you knew anything about a underwater boat?"</q></p>
            <p>"Aye I do indeed Mr. Torrens." the man goes on to explain that he heard an inventor by the name of Cornelius Fulton 
                had created a small boat that could travel underwater and that a him and his colleges were creating an improved version. 
                He gives you directions to a workshop near the water were the machine is being constructed.</p>

        <section id="gear-2b" class="hidden">
            <p>You admit to Rupert that you don't know exactly where the boat is. However you explain that as this ship must be 
                both located near the water and near to a mill that can fabricate the neccesary metal componets and that you know of a few likely spots to look.</p>

            <p><q>"Well you sound like you know what your talking about, lead the way."</q> Rupert says with a wave of his hand in 
                the direction of the docks. At the second location you think that you have found the right place.</p>

        <section id="gear-2" class="hidden">
            <p>The building is a large wooden shed that faces the water. A metal track has been laid that enters the water.
                As you approuch the entrance you can see a large armored figure standing before the door. He appears to be 
                a officer of the guard. Approaching him you ask if you may go inside.</p>
