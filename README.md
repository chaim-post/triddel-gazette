#The Triddel Gazette

This site describes the ancient city of Triddel, a central location in my pathfinder campaign setting.

##purpose

I created this site for several reasons:
* I needed a place to practice webdesign
* I wanted a newspaper to use as a prop for the campaign
* I wanted an excuse to write more often

In order to learn more about software development I created this [github](https://github.com/chaim-post/triddel-gazette) to practice using version control software.
