        <h2>Triddel: An Introduction to the Great City</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Triddel. If this is your first visit you are 
           likely overwhelmed by the immense splendor that is our city.
           Please allow me to assist you in your time of need by 
           explaining some of the history and geography of this city. 
           As well I will point out a few of the more important laws

        <h3 id="article2.2">A Brief History of the City</h3>
        <!--TODO fix style for h3s-->
        <p>Triddel is an ancient city. It is so old that we have unable 
        to determine who it's original inhabitants were or even what 
        sort of creature them may have been. We do know that it was a 
        center of planar trade for the Sehr-Ranee empire and that it was
         abandoned in the historic event that brought the downfall to 
         that enduring nation. It was left vacant for untold years until
         Volhardend ships, blown off course by a storm, discovered it. 
        They left a contingent of soldiers here and returned to their 
        land. But the soldiers in exploring their new home inadvertently
         activated the great portal that powers the many magics that 
        fill the city. This great surge of power alerted the Meritoire 
        to the cities existence and a thus started the struggle for 
        ownership of the city that would go on for the next thirty 
        years. Control of the city transferred between the two nations 
        several times throughout the end of the Aquitaine Conflicts six 
        years ago, when the two countries, at the behest of the Elves 
        established the new free city of Triddel.</p>

         <h3>A Description of the City and it's Wards</h3>
         <p>
The City of Triddel is built upon the surface of an immense cliff faced 
ring shaped island with a large plateau rising from the center of the 
interior cove. The interior cove surrounds a low circular wall of stone 
and in a few places overflows into a lake below. This lake flows out 
through a passage into a large cavern containing a gigantic whirlpool 
that is created by a large portal in the chamber's floor.  Towards the 
south-west a large strait crosses cuts through the island, connecting 
the cove to the sea. This passage allows access to several wards of the 
city built into the caverns that open into the cove. In the north-west 
corner of the island a large building covered chunk of the ring's 
plateau has fallen down and settled along the edge of the island.
         </p>
         <p>
The city of Triddel has many wards with many diverse businesses, 
architectures, and residents. A few of the larger wards of the city are 
described briefly below. For more information please purchase 
<a href="http://triddelgazette.altervista.org/pages/Triddel-guide.html"><em>Karl Murray's Guide to the City 
of Triddel</em></a> where ever quality books are sold.
         </p>
         <p>
<em>Two Score Towers</em> is a large cluster of colossal towers located 
upon the island's central plateau. Two Score Towers is Triddel's center 
of magic and learning and is home to the illustrious Triddel University. 
 Also located in Two Score Towers is The Reconditorium cognitione, the 
largest library in the world and home to some of the oldest tomes in 
existence.
         </p>
         <p>
The ancient <em>portal district</em> lies to the north-west of Two Score
 Towers along the island's ring. Here the scholars and scientists of the
 ministry of teleportation tirelessly work to restore the many portals 
that were the backbone of Triddel's commerce in days long past.
         </p>
         <p>
Sitting directly beneath the Portal District and reachable via numerous 
tunnels as well as a levitating platform is the crumbling buildings of 
<em>Ruin's Wharf</em>. Here you will find many fishing vessels docked as 
 well as many of the cities less fortunate newcomers. While one is 
advised to be wary of the many dangers of the wharf it can also be a 
wonderful spot to search for relics of the past recently uncovered by 
one of the many digging operations of this fallen part of the ancient 
city.
         </p>
         <p>
<em>Gear-home</em>, the heart of Triddel industry, is located on a 
several raised platforms of rock jetting out of the island's inner lake.
 These small islands are covered in factories, refineries, and 
rail-lines. This ward manufactures everything from clocks to steam-ships
 and is a first stop for anyone wishing to purchase the latest in 
mechanical advances.
         </p>
         <p>
Built on the cliffs that border the strait are the wards of <em>Port 
Bridge</em> and <em>Starboard Bridge</em>. The Bridge wards are home to 
the Triddel observatory as well as the Sir Davy Raffles Public 
Zoological Preserve.
         </p>
         <p>
The newly constructed <em>Triddel Worlds Fairgrounds</em>, no doubt the 
purpose of your visit to our city, can be found on the western side of 
the island and is reachable by air-carriages from all wards of the city 
and from portals located in Two Score Towers, The Portal District, and 
Old wharf.

         <h3>Some important laws of the city</h3>
         <p>
Sir Robert Brock, Commisioner of Security for the Fair, has requested 
that we appraise those visiting Triddel of a few important laws and 
regulations of the city.</p>
<p>
All visitors must present themselves to an officer of the guard before 
entering the city. Following an inspection and the payment of twenty 
copper pieces per person the visitors will be allowed access to the 
city.</p>
<p>
All dangerous creatures, devices, and substances, including weapons, 
wild beasts, and explosive or corrosive chemicals, must be declared to 
the guard for inspection and an appropriate permit purchased by their 
owner before they are permitted in the city. After a permit has been 
purchased a mark will be affixed to the creature or device, not to be 
removed until such time as it leaves the city. Any such creatures,

Any who shall be caught stealing must return that which they stole and 
add a 5th to the theft's value. In addition the thief shall spend a 
single night in a cell with naught but a small amount of bread and water
 to contemplate their sin. If this shall be the third time the thief has
 been thus sentenced then he shall be exiled from the city. In the event
 that the thief is unable to repay their dept their possessions shall be
 sold, and if this sale shall not cover the dept then the thief shall be
 sold and their wages given to the victim of their theft until such time
 as their dept is repaid in full.
